# React Error Boundaries

This is a demo app built for an article on my site: https://www.leighhalliday.com/error-boundaries-and-render-props

It's goal is to show how to use Error Boundaries in React and at the same time cover render props.

We'll also test our error boundary component to ensure it's trapping and rendering the handled response correctly.
